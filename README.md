# js-weather-app ðŸŒ¦

An application that implements the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current temperature (centigrade or fahrenheit) and weather from the user's current location or a location they specify.

## If you're planning on copying or downloading this project

- Please be sure to swap my OpenWeatherMap API key at the top of the **js/script.js** file with your own one to avoid maxing out my request limit.
- You can obtain your own API key for FREE at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.
